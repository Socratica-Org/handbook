**EVERYONE IS A HOST**

- For events of 45+ people, do the host pledge:
  - (Lead organizer) Put your hand on your heart and repeat after us:
  - (Event participant) I will not be a menace.
  - (Event participant) I will clean up my own garbage and the occasional additional cup
  - (Event participant) If I see someone standing alone in the corner I will go be their friend
- Tap people on the shoulder to “lead Socratica sessions”
- Get people to help you set up food etc. at the beginning / clean up chairs etc at the end. Seeing the “behind the scenes” makes people feel like a part of something
- Encourage people to organize their own Socratica-sponsored events (gym sessions, post-Socratica lunch, movie nights, meditation sessions)
