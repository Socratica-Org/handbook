NO SCHOOL / CO-OP ALLOWED - While doesn’t seem like a huge deal to let people work on whatever they want (including school)… - We are uninterested in volunteering our time and money to “permit and enable” people to do what they would have been doing anyways - This is a very slippery slope. Socratica dies when this fundamental rule goes away. Peer pressure and accountability only work when everyone is bought in. - It may be uncomfortable at first to say no, but people don’t really care about the result if their expectations are managed. The important thing is to present a united front, and people will adjust what they think they can do accordingly
